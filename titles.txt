Why isn’t there an equivalent phrase to ‘for good’ that’s ‘for evil’?
Maybe it was supposed to be don’t give up,\nAnd certainly not for good
Don't Quit, Quit
I don’t get what they were trying to go for.
oh yeah, I immediately did.

And good on him. I saw a YouTube video that talked about him and they mentioned an interview about him where he basically said that he was experimenting with pushing the limits of what was acceptable, but he did it as a very conscious choice.
Yeah, he moved on with his life.
Funnily enough he's now a full time musician
He also had a bunch of other characters. The guy made original songs and produced interesting videos. But he really went to the extreme with his skits.
YouTuber called Filthy Frank, now retired. Shitposter extraordinaire. Had a character on his channel called Pink Guy
Me neither. I just thought the face was funny.
Afraid I have no context here

that's not frank that's pink guy
I’d recommend the title “frankface”

And there wasn’t for that one, or this one either.

Ah, gotcha
It's something an old high-school-friend-turned-life-coach posted on FB the other day. I know her message was meant to be "the more you hold onto the pain instead of moving past it, the more you'll suffer", but I saw it as a formula for success around here (ie the more we complain, the more suffering we get to enjoy)
wouldn't suffering be pain/resistance?

Each one of them, out of context.
Like I said, I had to pare it done to the essentials. The thing immediately blowing up in our faces is fitting enough anyway. Also, this whole conversation is going to be used as titles.
Otherwise I’d be tempted to cheat.
Man, it sure is a good thing that Darling comes out on Saturdays.

Just a couple hours ago, I was looking up fictional T-Rexes to get ideas for my latest D&D character (long story), and it just so happened to lead me to this old manga about a t-rex named Ralph who dies in the mass extinction, and gets reincarnated into the body of a highschool girl
SO FUNNY YOU SHOULD SAY THAT

"If you want better anime, destroy the international banking cartels"

Now we are the dog and the bubble is the bad anime
Something something... in soviet Russia bad anime watches you.
We are both the watcher and the watch, the bad anime only exists because we perceive it. Without us, there would be no bad anime.
Basically, if we had stands, they would all just be Cheap Trick.
But then to get all metaphysical and shit, I feel like the people holding the bad-anime knives represent various aspects of ourselves
I felt that the cat represents us and each individual knife is a bad anime
The cat represents bad anime
Welp, I guess I was wrong the whole time:

I like the subtlety of "Tell Satan to keep it quiet up there."
"Every Saturday we meet in Satan's basement to watch bad anime, he prefers to stay upstairs."
"Tell Satan to keep it quiet up there."
"Are you going to talk to that asshole Satan again or will I have to?"
"The upstairs neighbors are making noise again."

I mean, it's totally valid, I have no idea what you're talking about.

for example, someone brings up skeletons and kiritron would post a link to a random image from the skeleton folder
maybe have subfolders for different themes
Make a folder for it, have the bot pull from there
We still have the Directorate GDrive
No guarantee that it will be worked on.
Your feature request is received.
You know, if we make a photobucket and upload the images from here to there we can have kiritron post the direct links to the relevant image
Man, I think that this weekend is when I FINALLY get to resume development on kiritron, and going through this chat for text is going to be a journey.
Have some skeletons, folks:
On a related note...\n"To fully comprehend trash you must first become it."
"Fuck it, I was going to Hell anyway."
What about the God of Nazis?
From an analysis of Yojou Senki, not exactly relevant to the suffering, but I liked the quote "We find ourselves rooting for Tanya in spite of her being an unabashed villain. Part of this is how the series is framed: because sure, we may hate nazis, but the only thing we hate more than nazis is god."\n
Mainly: "We may hate nazis, but the only thing we hate more than nazis is god"
Step 1: The inevitable heat death of the universe.\nStep 2: Fading away into nothingness.
Step 3: Profit.
In case Ryan or whoever is going to be copying the text for some sort of generator.
no exactly what I was thinking, but it totally works.
How about "I'll live a long life of depression and alcoholism before I let anime kill me"
No I get it
Or is that too noble bright for our little group?
"If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death, human life cannot be complete"
for example
"The reward of suffering is experience"
I feel like, we should have some positive quotes too, or at least some sort of creed of getting stronger for suffering. Something like what Guts went through in Berserk
yes, shitposting is not suffering, in fact it might be quite enjoyable for the person doing it.
We're not here to shitpost, were here to share in misery
How about this one?
I don't think that would make a good motto
Note to self: browse Nietzsche quotes and see how many can apply to us here
...in fact, the Trope page I got that quote from just sums this place up too well: "Despair Event Horizon"
"You know, apart from the fact that I'll never again experience joy in my life, I don't think this had any kind of negative effect on me."
"Every episode gets me closer to hell"
"Future scholars will debate on the collapse, but we had front row seats"
"We have opened a box that we can not close."
"Abandon all hope, ye who enters here"
I like Rando's art, but I think in this case we could change it to "We're just pretty fucked up"
I demand a page of 🤔 🔫
I think I can make it use emoji.
and it's just an accidental infinite loop while the function that changes the string he prints out breaks.
Up until it just starts saying "DIE" nonstop, then things might get too real at that point
"Please tell me that the hope is not the first step to disappointment." -possible future kiritron quote
To try and fit in.
Or just tries to say similar stuff to all of us.
If so, I'd sort of want him to start as a learning AI that bases it's emoji usage off of us
Can Kiritron use emojis?
Although please don't stop sharing the images, they're great.
Just a warning, ONCE I FINALLY GET TO GO BACK TO WORK ON KIRITRON AGAIN, I can only use text.
Pure poetry, the both of you
There are no actual words, but somehow it still feels appropriate:
"The *only* silver lining, to any of this, is that we will all be dead someday."
"Please tell me this is all a bad dream"
"Hope is the first step on the road to disappointment."
*Wailing intensifies until a sudden game pause*
(dictated and read, by Victor)
"Time has lost its effect on me, yet the suffering continues."
"Monstrosities of Sin"
"I have a pretty good idea of why you returned to Luna Nova now."
*little bitch tears
"Cry your little bitch tears"
"Like a giant f*cking centipede made of rib cages and hatred."
which, contrary to the context presented here, isn't overly critical
also I didn't name it, that's just the video it's from
Fun fact: When your computer isn't doing anything while you play persona, making webms doesn't feel like an eternity
"This is Hell. Everything is going to be painful"
"It's like purgatory, but for anime."
"Smells like shame, fear and cheaply made anime goods in here"
"Don't give up, skeleton"
"Help me..."
"No gods. No kings. Only Kirito."
"I CAN FEEL THE WARP OVERTAKING ME - IT IS A GOOD PAIN"
ah, good one
"I AM NOT LOCKED IN HERE WITH YOU, YOU ARE LOCKED IN HERE WITH ME"
"The Wrath of Pooseidon"
"No matter how bad things get, they will always get worse!"
"So bad it triggers the coming of the Ouroboros"
Oh, as perfect as that line is, we'd be besmirching our proud history if we left out "The ride never ends", "I want to get off Mr. Bone's Wild Ride", and "Don't forget, you're here forever"
_slowclap_
👏
Definitely
"Every day, we stray further from God's light" is a classic, ofc
I feel that also get the point across, although it isn't a direct quote
_The punishment will continue as long as you live_
Also because New Vegas is GOAT
I just pawned that from the quotes section
For real though look up the "Death Seeker" article on tvtropes
aye
_The Suffering: "Because I'm Still Alive."_ Is a bit more concise and snappy.
Hmm
Courier: "How do you know your punishment isn't over?"\nBoone: "Because I'm still alive."
"Fan-freaking-tastic, we're back here again" -Kami
lol
"Better dead than continue living" -Horrors of Spider Island
